## 1. Star ship
The game consists of a star ship/player that fires at the oncoming enemies. The enemies can be asteroids,
meteroids or rockets from alien space ship. The enemies appear randomly and each approach our star ship at different
speeds. The goal of the game is to shoot all the aproaching enemy targets and restrict them from crossing
or colliding with our ship. Points are earned in accordance to the speed of the enemy taken down i.e. taking down
a faster enemy earns more points.
